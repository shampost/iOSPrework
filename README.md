## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
1. Partiful: good, refreshing design; intuitive interface; good use of 3D effects
2. Instagram: intuitive navigation; straighforward UI; good feature set
3. WHOO: fun to use; simple; easy to naviate

I want to create an app that brings long-distance couples together through small interactions like photo requests, vibrations, custom stickers, and more. The app should be a one-stop-shop for anything long-distance couples could need. Many apps on the current market are simply not inventive enough and only allow for surface-level connection through somes sort of question game or calendar tracking. I think there can be more done to connect people across distances.

## Notes

The name of the Storyboard was different than the tutorial so it took me an extra minute to orient myself.
